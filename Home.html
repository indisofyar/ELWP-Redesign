												<p>		<b>		The East London Waterworks Park is an idea conceived by local people. 
														</b>
														At its heart is a community group that wants to acquire and transform the 5.68-hectare ex-Thames Water Depot on Lea Bridge Road in Waltham Forest into a brownfield rainforest offering people the opportunity to immerse themselves in nature. 
														Activities, including wild swimming in Victorian filter beds and conservation volunteering, will improve physical and mental health, increase biodiversity and encourage visitors to stay and explore.
												</p>
										<p>		Currently a fenced-in concrete depot in the middle of a swathe of green space, opening the East London Waterworks Park will reconnect the lower Lea Valley. 
												It will also showcase an environment-first community-led approach to land ownership that will transform the way we think about green spaces.
