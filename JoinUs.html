			  					<p>		Before getting in touch, you will need to understand a little about how we are organised. 
			  							Our day-to-day work is carried out by circles. 
			  							All of our members belong to a circle (most belong to just one circle, but you can belong to more if you wish). 
			  							These are the circles that we currently have.
