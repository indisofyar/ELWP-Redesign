							  <h1>Engineering pre-feasibility report</h1>
							  <h2>This report examines the feasibility of the East London Waterworks Park concept, delving into how we’ll create the infrastructure that will form the heart of the project.</h2>
						      <h3>June 2022</h3>
							</div>
						  	<div class="col-md-8">
							  <p>The purpose of this report is to summarise the outcomes of an initial engineering feasibility study for the creation of the East London Waterworks Park, within the Lea Valley, in North-East London.</p>

							  <p>The site is part of the former Essex Filter Beds built in the 1850’s for the treatment of water supplied to East London, which closed in the early 1970’s. It covers an area of approximately 6ha adjacent to Lea Bridge Road and is currently occupied by Thames Water.</p>

							  <p>The community-led East London Waterworks Park project proposes to restore the site, create a park with a biodiverse mosaic of ecological habitats, with natural swimming pools, a café, a community hub, learning facilities and visitor accommodation within the existing buildings.</p>

							  <p>The project focuses on returning the site to community use and its ecological function as a key part of the Lea Valley, with environmental sustainability and regenerative design at the heart of the approach.</p>

							  <p>Four thematic workshops (including a baseline analysis workshop) have been held between Expedition and the East London Waterworks Park team between December 2021 and May 2022.</p>

							  <p>These workshops have considered key engineering issues, summarised risks, constraints and opportunities and outlined initial engineering strategies. This report summarises these considerations and outlines the emerging strategies. It is organised as follows:</p>
							  <ul>
								<li>Section 2 presents a baseline analysis of the site, including its history, topography, hydrology, utilities and ground conditions.</li>
								<li>Section 3 outlines the strategy for the creation of the natural swimming pools.</li>
								<li>Section 4 discusses the sustainable drainage strategy and integration with the river corridor.</li>
								<li>Section 5 summarises key issues associated with the ground conditions and outlines the strategy for dealing with contaminated grounds.</li>
								<li>Section 6 outlines the zero carbon and energy strategy.</li>
								<li>Section 7 discusses circular economy opportunities.</li>
								<li>Section 8 presents the key conclusions and recommendations.</li>

						      <h3>June 2022</h3>

						  	<div class="col-md-8">
							  <p>East London Waterworks Park is committed to inclusivity. We want to ensure that everybody feels welcome in and around the project and that the park itself is designed to welcome everybody. To ensure we do more than simply pay lip service to this idea, the inclusivity circle embarked on a listening project to find out what inclusive means to the diverse range of people living in our community.</p>

							  <p>Phase one of the listening project focused on desk research. We read as much as we could about the needs and experiences of the following groups in relation to community spaces and green and blue places: women, disabled people, people from ethnic minorities, children, people from disadvantaged backgrounds and people on low incomes. From our findings, we developed eight inclusivity principles.</p>

							  <p>Phase two of the listening project tested these inclusivity principles with twelve community organisations representing groups of people that are historically underrepresented in environmental projects like East London Waterworks Park.</p>
							  <ol>
									<li>Interlink Foundation, representing Orthodox Jews</li>
									<li>MIND, representing people with mental health difficulties</li>
									<li>English Conversation Club, representing people who do not speak English as a first language</li>

							  </ol>
							  <p>Participants were offered a £50 donation as a thank you for their time; donations were made to nine organisations and three declined the offer.</p>
							  <p>This report summarises the feedback we received for each inclusivity principle and, where appropriate, proposes revised wording for the principles. It also gathers together participants’ thoughts on phase three of the listening project and puts forward a proposal for phase three.</p>

							  <h1>Inclusivity listening project: phase two report</h1>
							  <h2>This report describes phase two of East London Waterworks Park’s inclusivity listening project, which is designed to ensure that everybody feels welcome in and around the project and that the park is designed to welcome everybody.</h2>
						      <h3>June 2022</h3>
							</div>
						  	<div class="col-md-8">
							  <p>East London Waterworks Park is committed to inclusivity. We want to ensure that everybody feels welcome in and around the project and that the park itself is designed to welcome everybody. To ensure we do more than simply pay lip service to this idea, the inclusivity circle embarked on a listening project to find out what inclusive means to the diverse range of people living in our community.</p>

							  <p>Phase one of the listening project focused on desk research. We read as much as we could about the needs and experiences of the following groups in relation to community spaces and green and blue places: women, disabled people, people from ethnic minorities, children, people from disadvantaged backgrounds and people on low incomes. From our findings, we developed eight inclusivity principles.</p>

							  <p>Phase two of the listening project tested these inclusivity principles with twelve community organisations representing groups of people that are historically underrepresented in environmental projects like East London Waterworks Park.</p>
							  <ol>
									<li>Interlink Foundation, representing Orthodox Jews</li>
									<li>MIND, representing people with mental health difficulties</li>
									<li>English Conversation Club, representing people who do not speak English as a first language</li>
									<li>Waltham Forest Women’s Network, representing women</li>
									<li>elop, representing LGBTQ+ people</li>
									<li>Millfields Community School Parent Staff Association, representing parents with young children</li>
									<li>Waltham Forest Young Advisors, representing younger people</li>
									<li>Voyage Youth, representing Black people and particularly younger Black people</li>
									<li>Connect Hackney, representing older people</li>
									<li>Muslamic Makers, representing Muslims</li>
									<li>A speech and language therapist with experience of working with children and young people who have special educational needs, representing children and young people with special educational needs</li>
									<li>Made in Hackney, representing people from disadvantaged backgrounds and people on low incomes</li>
							  </ol>
							  <p>Participants were offered a £50 donation as a thank you for their time; donations were made to nine organisations and three declined the offer.</p>
							  <p>This report summarises the feedback we received for each inclusivity principle and, where appropriate, proposes revised wording for the principles. It also gathers together participants’ thoughts on phase three of the listening project and puts forward a proposal for phase three.</p>
